# Stargate Sequence Inspired from 2001: A Space odyssey

This is an animated poster for the movie rendered on html canvas using JavaScript. At first it looks complicated, but it's alright. Just a bunch of parameterized shapes grouped into patterns. Check scripts/space-odyssey.js

A good challenge would be to have this sync with music. May be for another day..

A demo of this is hosted here:
